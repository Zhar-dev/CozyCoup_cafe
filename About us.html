                <h1>Our History</h1>
                <p>Cozy Cup Cafe was founded by Al-nizar Wahab and Christian Clavite, who shared a passion for great coffee and a vision for creating a welcoming gathering spot for locals. What started as a humble storefront has blossomed into a beloved fixture of the neighborhood, thanks to the support of our loyal customers and dedicated team. Over the years, we've grown and evolved, but our commitment to quality and community remains unchanged. From our carefully crafted espresso drinks to our freshly baked pastries, every item on our menu is made with love and care. As we look to the future, we're excited to continue serving our community and spreading joy, one cup at a time. Whether you're a regular or a first-time visitor, we can't wait to welcome you to the Cozy Cup family!</p>
